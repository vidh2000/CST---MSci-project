1. Optimise "isLink" function in causetevent.py
    Is very slow as set operations are shit.
    Initial soln: maybe just do a.isFutureLink(b) after sorting a,b by
    time coordinate? Should be faster as no intersections of sets.
2. Optimise/paralelise "isCausal_____" functions in spacetimes.py.
    Should be able to do more event pairs at the same time.
3. Any ideas?
