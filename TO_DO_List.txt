VID IDEAS FOR FAST CODE

1. Optimise "isLink" function in causetevent.py
    Is very slow as set operations are shit.
    Initial soln: maybe just do a.isFutureLink(b) after sorting a,b by
    time coordinate? Should be faster as no intersections of sets.
2. Optimise/paralelise "isCausal_____" functions in spacetimes.py.
    Should be able to do more event pairs at the same time.
3. Use lists to store information for events. Much faster in python as while 
    dictionaries/sets are nice... take space and slower.

TO DO

1. Fix 1+1D Schwarzschild spacetime algo/check the algorithm as it seems wrong.
    Should give causal relations only into the blackhole.
    y-axis: time
    x-axis: r.
    Then do 2+1D with horizon at some radius
    x,y-axis: x,y
    z-axis: time.
    Should only have relations upwards into the circle.
    Then onto the 3+1D e.g. identically as to what they do
    in the He,Rideout 2009 paper.
2.  a) Define algo/code to be able to count links over the horizon
        (test in 1+1 Schwarzschild and simpler spacetimes) 
    b) Update to include higher-order links for 3+1D spacetimes
3.  C++ code to speed things up.
    Parallel procesing.


USEFUL CODING INFORMATION
Rideout and He 2009;
Schwarzschild spacetime embedding/causality algorithm which makes it faster
by not always needing to calculate the integral of ds.
Otherwise reeduced 3+1D into 2+1D...
