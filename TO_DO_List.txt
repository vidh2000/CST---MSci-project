## INSTRUCTIONS and USEFUL TIPS

HOW TO RUN C++ code using compiler optimisation:
g++ -g -O3 filename.cpp -std=c++17
-> Creates a.exe file 
To execute, type: ./a into the command line
---- We can probably add this into json for automatic compiling... ----

### Ideas for fast code
Stefano: watch -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfV8aRX0YY0&t=3s
- Multiplying is slower than bitshifting -> use that instead of 
setting the value in matrix = 1?
- Take care to not redefine the value of the variable but just to increment it
- Remove repeated calculations
- unravel loops


### Tasks: 
1. Finish sprinkled causet which calls the methods of "intensify" or
"cardinality".
2. Create embeddedCauset class which calls the spacetime/shape you want
to embed it in, and also allows for constructing the causet based on
inputting a causal matrix
(Stefano... I feel this is so reduntant, we only need two causet classes max...) 
3. Causet class contains functions for creating the Causal Matrix
in a fast and efficient way, and other useful functions for
storing the matrix, getting properties of the causet, links etc.


### Schwarzschild spacetime algorithm ###
Rideout and He 2009;
Schwarzschild spacetime embedding/causality algorithm which makes it faster
by not always needing to calculate the integral of ds.
Otherwise reeduced 3+1D into 2+1D...
