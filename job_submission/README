# Instructions For Submission

Use \{name\}_submitter.sh files to submit files, with name being either

- linkcounting
- lambda counting

Other things are "old", before the proper job submission scripts were written
which submit 1 job per mass.

## Requirements

Requires miniconda and boost. The latter works with version 1.80.0, available as <https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.80.0/source/boost_1_80_0.tar.gz/download>. No idea for the other versions. These have to be installed as:

- homedir/miniconda
- homedir/boost/boost_1_80_0

## Results

The results are then written into the text file with avg and std of the links/lambdas/HRV molecules
counted for specific causet generation configuration.
